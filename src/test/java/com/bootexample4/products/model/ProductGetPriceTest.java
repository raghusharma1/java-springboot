Certainly! Below are the test scenarios for the `getPrice()` method in the `Product` entity.

```
Scenario 1: Validate positive price retrieval

Details:
  TestName: validatePositivePriceRetrieval
  Description: This test checks the retrieval of a positive price value from a Product instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product instance and set a positive price using setPrice().
  Act: Retrieve the price using getPrice().
  Assert: Assert that the retrieved price is equal to the set price.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that getPrice() accurately retrieves the price that was set, ensuring the method's reliability for positive values.
  This test is significant to confirm that the pricing logic in the application correctly handles standard positive pricing scenarios.

Scenario 2: Validate zero as price

Details:
  TestName: validateZeroPriceRetrieval
  Description: This test ensures that the method can correctly handle and retrieve a price of zero, which might represent free items or promotions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product instance and set the price to zero using setPrice().
  Act: Retrieve the price using getPrice().
  Assert: Assert that the retrieved price is zero.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that getPrice() correctly returns a price of zero when set, which is crucial for correctly handling free or promotional products.
  This test is important for applications that might have promotional items priced at zero, ensuring the system handles such cases without error.

Scenario 3: Validate negative price retrieval

Details:
  TestName: validateNegativePriceRetrieval
  Description: This test checks whether the getPrice() method can handle and return negative prices, which might be used in specific business scenarios like accounting adjustments.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product instance and set a negative price using setPrice().
  Act: Retrieve the price using getPrice().
  Assert: Assert that the retrieved price is the same negative value that was set.
Validation:
  This assertion ensures that getPrice() handles negative values, which can be important for scenarios requiring price adjustments or refunds represented as negative prices.
  This test is significant to ensure the system's flexibility in handling various pricing strategies, including negative values for specific business rules.

Scenario 4: Validate price precision and rounding

Details:
  TestName: validatePricePrecisionAndRounding
  Description: This test verifies that getPrice() retrieves prices with high precision, which is critical for accurate financial calculations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product instance and set a price with high decimal precision using setPrice().
  Act: Retrieve the price using getPrice().
  Assert: Assert that the retrieved price matches the set price up to the expected number of decimal places.
Validation:
  The assertion checks the precision of price retrieval, which is crucial for ensuring financial accuracy in transactions.
  This test is important to verify that the system maintains precision in financial figures, avoiding rounding errors that could lead to significant discrepancies.
```

These scenarios cover various typical and edge cases for the `getPrice()` method, ensuring thorough testing of its functionality in different contexts.
