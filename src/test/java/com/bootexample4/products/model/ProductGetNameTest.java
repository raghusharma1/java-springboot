```plaintext
Scenario 1: Test getName with default initialization

Details:
  TestName: getNameWithDefaultInitialization
  Description: Tests getName method to ensure it returns null when the Product name has not been initialized.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class without setting the name.
  Act: Call the getName method on the Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test verifies that the default state of the 'name' field is null if not explicitly set.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This is significant to ensure that the entity behaves correctly under default conditions, particularly useful in scenarios where new Product instances might be created without immediate name assignment.

Scenario 2: Test getName after setting a valid name

Details:
  TestName: getNameAfterSettingValidName
  Description: Tests the getName method to ensure it correctly returns the name that was set using setName.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class and set the name using setName method.
  Act: Call the getName method on this Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the name set.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test checks if getName correctly retrieves the name that was previously set.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: Ensuring that setName and getName work as expected is crucial for the application to correctly display or utilize the product name in its operations.

Scenario 3: Test getName with empty string as name

Details:
  TestName: getNameWithEmptyString
  Description: Tests the getName method to ensure it returns an empty string if an empty string was set as the name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class and set the name to an empty string using setName.
  Act: Call the getName method on this Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is an empty string.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test verifies that getName can handle and return an empty string.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This test is important to confirm that the system handles and correctly displays products that might not have a name assigned yet, or where the name is intentionally left blank.

Scenario 4: Test getName with special characters in name

Details:
  TestName: getNameWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: Tests the getName method to ensure it returns the exact string, including special characters, when such a string is set as the name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Product class and set the name to a string containing special characters using setName.
  Act: Call the getName method on this Product instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the string with special characters.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: The test checks if getName can accurately retrieve names containing special characters.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test: This verifies the system's capability to handle product names with non-standard characters, which might be necessary for internationalization or certain product categories.
