```
Scenario 1: Product Exists and is Successfully Deleted

Details:
  TestName: deleteExistingProduct
  Description: This test checks whether a product that exists in the database can be successfully deleted using the deleteProduct method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return a valid Product object when findById is called with a specific ID.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with the ID of the existing product.
  Assert: Verify that the response is a successful (200 OK) ResponseEntity and that the productRepository.delete method was called with the correct product.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. The test validates that the method correctly deletes an existing product and returns a successful response, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity and user expectations in the application.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. Ensuring that products are correctly deleted when requested affects inventory management and user experience.

Scenario 2: Product Does Not Exist

Details:
  TestName: deleteNonExistingProduct
  Description: This test verifies that the deleteProduct method correctly handles the case where a product with the given ID does not exist in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with a non-existing ID.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with the non-existing product ID.
  Assert: Verify that the response is a not found (404 Not Found) ResponseEntity and that the productRepository.delete method was not called.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. The test confirms that the method does not attempt to delete a non-existing product and correctly returns a not found response, which is important for error handling and user feedback.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. Proper handling of non-existing entities prevents data corruption and ensures that users are informed about incorrect actions or requests.

Scenario 3: Database Access Issues During Product Deletion

Details:
  TestName: deleteProductWithDatabaseIssues
  Description: This test ensures that the deleteProduct method behaves correctly when there are underlying database access issues, such as a database connection failure.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to throw a DataAccessException (or similar database access exception) when findById or delete is called.
  Act: Call deleteProduct with any product ID.
  Assert: Verify that an appropriate exception is thrown or handled, and check the type of ResponseEntity returned.
Validation:
  Clarify what the assertion aims to verify and the reason behind the expected result. This test checks how the method handles unexpected exceptions during database operations, which is crucial for robustness and reliability of the application.
  Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic. Ensuring that the application gracefully handles database errors prevents crashes and provides a better user experience by handling errors appropriately.
